## Description

_Create a program that calculates a user's age on other planets based on inputted date._


### Specs
| Spec | Input |  Expected Output  |
| :-------------    | :------------- | :------------- | 
| Program will accept an age input | "21" |  Returns 21  |
| Program will convert age in Earth years to age in Mercury years (.24 Earth years) | "21 Earth Years" |  "87.5 Mercury years"  |
| Program will convert age in Earth years to age in Venus years (.62 Earth years) | "30 Earth Years" |  "48.4 Mercury years"  |
| Program will convert age in Earth years to age in Mars years (1.88 Earth years) | "16 Earth Years" |  "8.5 Mars years"  |
| Program will convert age in Earth years to age in Jupiter years (11.86 Earth years) | "45 Earth Years" |  "3.8 Jupiter years"  |
| Program will convert age in Earth years to age in Saturn years (29.46 Earth years) | "27 Earth Years" |  "0.9 Saturn years"  |
| Program will convert age in Earth years to age in Uranus years (84.01 Earth years) | "42 Earth Years" |  "0.5 Uranus years"  |
| Program will determine remaining life expectancy in Earth years | current age: "56" life expectancy "76" |  "20 Earth years"  |
| Program will determine remaining life expectancy in for each planet | current age: "56" life expectancy "76" |  "32 Venus years", "1.7 Jupiter years"  |
| If a user has already surpassed their life expectancy, program will calculate their years beyond expectancy | current age: "99" life expectancy "76" |  "23 Earth years beyond expectancy"  |
| If a user has already surpassed their life expectancy, program will calculate their years beyond expectancy for other planets| current age: "99" life expectancy "76" |  "95.8 Mars years beyond expectancy"  |
